# Arcade-Game 🎮

Arcade-Game is a simple Python program that presents a game menu with multiple mini-games.  
Currently, it includes:
- **Guess the Number** 🎯
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors** ✊✋✌️

It was developed inside a Python virtual environment and can be extended with more games in the future.

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- No external libraries are required (uses only Python's standard library).
